Comparring the staging area with repos, use "git diff --staged"
Reset all changes: "git reset --hard"

Checkout master: git checkout master -> user when you want to go back to the latest version master branch

Branch:
- "git branch" : view all branches
- "git branch <label>": create a new branch with the label
- "git checkout <label">: switch to the branch
- "git log --graph --oneline <branch1> <branch2>": show the graph of commits on two branches

Reflection:
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- Use git log to list all commits. Use git diff new-version old-version to track changes in each commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- Git works with coding, changes in one file may relate to other files. While Google docs deal less with this issue.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- We can also revert to the older version when it was working, see what changes that may lead to the break and fix them.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- Maintain my own projects

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- A temporary staging before commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- View status before commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- Try a experimental features, in development, without affecting the main branch

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
- Automerging: fast <> not correct all the time
- Merge manually: slow <> correct
